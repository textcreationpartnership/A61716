            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>May it pleaſe your ſacred Majeſty,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been my greateſt griefe in all theſe troubles, to be taken as a perſon which ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repreſent and ſet things amiſſe betweene your Majeſtie and your people; and to give Counſells tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſquiet of the three Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Moſt true it is, that this mine own private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition conſidered, it had been a great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſince through your gracious favour I was ſo provided, as not to expect in any kinde to mend my fortune, or pleaſe my mind more, then by reſting where your bounteous hands had placed me.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51252:3"/>
            <p> Nay, it is moſt mightily miſtaken, for unto your Majeſtie it is well known, my poore, and humble adviſes concluded ſtill in this, That your Majeſtie and your people could never be happy, till there were a right underſtanding betwixt you and them: no other means to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſettle this happineſſe, but by the Councell, and aſſent of the Parliament; or to prevent the growing evills upon this State but by intirely putting your ſelfe in the laſt reſort, upon the loyalty, and good affections of your Engliſh Subjects.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch is my misfortune, this truth findeth little credit, the contrary ſeemeth generally to be beleeved, and my ſelfe reputed, as ſome thing of ſeparation between you, and your peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple; under a heavier cenſure then which I am perſwaded no Gentleman can ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Now, I underſtand the minds of men are more incenſed againſt me, notwithſtanding your Majeſtie hath declared, that in your Princely opinion, I am not guilty of treaſon, nor are you ſatisfied in your conſcience to paſſe the Bill.</p>
            <p>This bringeth me into a very great ſtreight, there is before me the ruine of my Children, and Family, hitherto untouched, in all the branches of it with any foule crimes. Here is before me the many ills, which may befall your ſacred Perſon, and the whole Kingdome, ſhould your ſelfe, and Parliament part leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:51252:3"/> ſatisfied one with the other, then is neceſſary for the preſervation both of King and people. Here are before me the things moſt valued, moſt feared, by mortall man, <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay Sir, that there hath not been a ſtrife in me, were to make me leſſe man, than God knoweth, mine infirmities give me. And to call a deſtruction upon my ſelf, and young Children, where the intentions of my heart (at leaſt have been innocent of this great offence) may be believed, will finde no eaſie content from fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>But with much ſadneſſe, I am come to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, of that which I take to be beſt becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, to look upon that which is moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall in it ſelf, which doubtleſſe is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of your ſacred perſon, and the common wealth, infinitely before any private mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore in few words, as I put my ſelf wholly upon the honour, and juſtice of my Peers ſo clearly, as to beſeech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty might pleaſe to have ſpared that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of yours on Saturday laſt, and intirely to have left me to their Lordſhips; ſo now, to ſet your Majeſties conſcience at liberty, I do moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, in prevention of miſtakes which may happen, by your refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, to paſſe this B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll; And by this means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move (prayſed be God) I cannot ſay, this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed (but I confeſſe) this unfortunate thing
<pb facs="tcp:51252:4"/> forth of the way, towards that bleſſed agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God I truſt, ſhall ever eſtabliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and your ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Sir, my conſent ſhall more acquit you herein to God, than all the world can do beſides. To a willing man there is no injury done. And as by Gods grace, I forgive all the world with a calmneſſe and meekneſſe of infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to my diſlodging ſoul; So Sir, to you can I give the life of this world, with all the cheerfulneſſe imaginable; in the juſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of your exceeding favours. And onely beg that in your goodneſſe, you would vouchſafe to caſt your gracious regard upon my poor Son, and his three Siſters, leſſe, or more, and no otherwiſe, than as their (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) unfortunate Father, may hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more or leſſe guilty of this death.</p>
